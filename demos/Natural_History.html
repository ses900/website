  <h1>Evolutionary History and the Flow of Entropy</h1>

  <section>
    <p>
      Life on Earth is a local expression of thermodynamic imbalance. We harvest low-entropy energy from the Sun—photons in ordered, high-frequency states—and transform it into temporary structures of biological complexity. These fragile structures, such as cells, tissues, and organisms, persist only so long as they dissipate energy back into the environment in higher-entropy forms, primarily as heat.
    </p>

    <h2>From Simplicity to Complexity</h2>
    <p>
      Early life began as single-celled organisms. These systems absorbed low-entropy inputs (e.g., sunlight or chemical gradients) and used them to assemble ordered internal states. Through processes like polymerization, simple monomers formed complex polymers—proteins, RNA, and DNA. The emergence of multicellular life represented a further step toward higher-order organization, all fueled by an increasing rate of entropy production.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biological evolution can thus be viewed as a thermodynamic mechanism for channeling energy dissipation through ever more structured—and temporarily ordered—pathways. The complexity we observe is not a defiance of entropy, but a consequence of it: a byproduct of systems optimizing the rate at which they degrade free energy into heat.

    <h2>Entropy, Information, and Memory</h2>
    <p>
      Entropy can be interpreted as a loss of information about the system's exact microstate. The heat we release into the environment carries less specific information than the structured molecules that generated it. Over time, this leads to a universe that appears to forget. Macrostates dominate because they can arise from countless microstates.
    </p>
    <p>
      This view contrasts sharply with certain interpretations of quantum mechanics. In particular, the principle of unitarity in quantum theory suggests that information is never lost. When a quantum system is observed, the Schrödinger wave function appears to "collapse" (as per Heisenberg's uncertainty principle), but theoretically the underlying information is preserved. This tension—between classical thermodynamic irreversibility and quantum informational conservation—remains one of the deepest puzzles in modern physics.

    <h2>Paths of Least Resistance and the Principle of Least Action</h2>
    <p>
      The natural evolution of physical systems often follows the path of least action, as described by the Lagrangian formulation in physics. In this view, systems evolve along trajectories that minimize (or extremize) the difference between kinetic and potential energy over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a thermodynamic context, the "least action" may correspond to the most efficient or probable path for entropy production. Identifying the correct Lagrangian in such systems is nontrivial—it must account for not just mechanics, but energy flows, dissipation, and the emergence of order in far-from-equilibrium conditions. Evolution, viewed this way, is not random but constrained by energetic pathways that favor increased entropy, shaped by local gradients and boundary conditions.
